<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i>“World’s Greatest
Card Game”</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ken Fisher, creator of Superquiz proudly presents Wizard,
the ultimate card game.  No other card game combines such ease of learning with
such opportunity for skillful play.  In fact, it is the only game which a
master player can consistently win regardless of the cards dealt.  While
definitely a game of skill, young and/or inexperienced players can join in
without disturbing the quality of play.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wizard: “<i>One endowed with exceptional skill or able to
achieve something held to be impossible.</i>” Webster’s Dictionary</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Wizard:</b> A family game for 3 – 6 players. Ages 10 and
up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>MATERIALS</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>A 60 card deck consisting of a normal playing deck plus four
Wizards and four Jesters.  The Jesters are lowest in value followed by two up
to ace, with Wizards highest in value.  A score pad is included.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>OBJECT OF THE GAME</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The object is to correctly predict the number of tricks you
will take in each round.  You receive points for being correct and the person
with the most points wins the game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>THE DEAL</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>To determine a dealer, each player is dealt one card.  High
card deals.  On the first deal each player receives one card.  Two cards are
dealt on the second deal, three on the third and so on.  The deal passes to the
left after each round and the new dealer shuffles all 60 cards.  After the
deal, the next card is turned up to determine the trump suit.  If the card
turned up is a Jester, it is turned down and there is no trump for that round. 
If the card turned up is a Wizard, the dealer chooses one of the four suits as
the trump suit.  The dealer may examine his cards before declaring the suit. 
On the last round of each game all cards are dealt out so there is no trump.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>BIDDING</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each player in turn, beginning to the left of the dealer,
states the number of tricks he/she will take (zero or one on the first round)
and the scorer records it on the score pad.  The total number of tricks bid may
or may not equal the total number of tricks available.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>THE PLAY</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The play begins to the left of the dealer.  Any card may be
led.  Players continue to play in clockwise order and must follow suit if
possible.  There are tow exceptions to this rule.  A Wizard or a Jester may be
played AT ANY TIME, even if the player is holding a card of the suit led.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>A trick is won:</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>(a)  By the first Wizard played.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(b)  If no Wizard is played, by the highest trump played.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(c)  If no trump is played, by the highest card of the suit
led.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The winner of the trick leads.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>LEADING WIZARDS OR JESTERS</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the lead card is a Wizard it wins the trick and players
may play any card they wish including another Wizard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the lead card is a Jester it is a null card.  The suit
for this round is determined by the next card played.  Jesters always lose. 
The one exception to this is if only Jesters are played in any one round, the
first Jester played wins the trick.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>SCORING</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>For correctly predicting the number of tricks taken a player
scores 20 points and receives 10 additional points for each trick taken.  A
player whose prediction is incorrect loses 10 points for each over or under
trick.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>LENGTH OF GAME</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are 60 cards in the deck.  Play continues until the
round in which all the cards are dealt out.  Consequently three players play 20
rounds, four players play 15 rounds, five players 12 rounds, and six players 10
rounds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>KEEPING TRACK OF TRICKS</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before the play begins the scorer should announce how many
tricks have been called for by each player.  Also each player should keep
tricks won in plain view for others to see.  Some players find it helpful to
use coins or poker chips to indicate the number of tricks called for.  This
enables all players to readily see how many tricks each player needs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span style='font-style:normal'>BIDDING VARIATIONS</span></h2>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Hidden Bid: All players simultaneously reveal their bid</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Delayed Reveal Bid: All players record their bid.  After
     the hand has been played the bids are revealed.</li>
</ol>
